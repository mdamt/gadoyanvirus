INSTALLATION NOTES
* Install ClamAV[1]. I use version 0.70. You have to manage your virus database
  according to ClamAV documentation.

* Run configure, available options are:

  --gadoyanvirus
	Directory which you want to install gadoyanvirus. Quarantine directory
	will be located under this directory
	Default: /opt/gadoyanvirus

  --with-clamav
    Installation directory of ClamAV.
	Default: /usr

  --with-smtp-user
    Username who runs the smtp server. Change to vpopmail if you use vpopmail
	Default: qmaild

  --with-qmail-queue
    qmail-queue program.
	Default: /var/qmail/bin/qmail-queue

  --with-virusmaster
    The email address used to send notification address. Notification
	will be disabled if you don't supply this flag. You must recompile
	if you want to activate/deactivate it later.
	Default: none

  Example: You want to use vpopmail as the smtp user, ClamAV is located at 
           /opt/clamav and gadoyanvirus will be installed in /opt/gadoyanvirus

		   The configuration command is:

           ./configure --prefix=/opt/gadoyanvirus --with-clamav=/opt/clamav\
		   --with-smtp-user=vpopmail
   
* Compile gadoyanvirus. As easy as:

  # make && make install

  Your gadoyanvirus binary will be installed as gadoyanvirus located in
  gadoyanvirus installation dir (see --with-gadoyanvirus flag above)

  The installation also will create the quarantine directory

* Put it in your tcp.smtp, something like this:
  :allow,TMPDIR="/tmp",QMAILQUEUE="/opt/gadoyanvirus/bin/gadoyanvirus"

  or if your ClamAV installation is not in your library path, you can try:
  :allow,TMPDIR="/tmp",LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/clamav/lib",QMAILQUEUE="/opt/gadoyanvirus/bin/gadoyanvirus"

  put RELAYCLIENT="" if you want to make your smtp server to relay messages.
  if you already have tcp.smtp file, add TMPDIR and QMAILQUEUE variable on each entry you 
  want gadoyanvirus to be activated. Then rebuild the rule database with:

  # tcprules /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb /etc/tcp.smtp.tmp < /etc/tcp.smtp

* vpopmail users only: You might want to increase the memory allocation defined by vpopmail
  Do it if the smtp server can't invoke gadoyanvirus.

HOW TO USE
* run gadoyanvirus as root 

  # gadoyanvirus

  or if your ClamAV installation is not in your library path, try:

  # LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/clamav/lib TMPDIR=/tmp gadoyanvirus

  Do it once, just once.

  A moment later, gadoyanvirus will change to user id qmaild (or to other user
  which is running your smtp server) and stays in the background.

  To force gadoyanvirus to reload the ClamAV virus database, try:

  # killall -HUP gadoyanvirus

  (note that if there's no new database, gadoyanvirus will not reload it)

  or if you hate gadoyanvirus so much, you can kill gadoyanvirus by doing:
  
  # killall -9 gadoyanvirus

  Please note that all incoming mails will be defered in SMTP level if 
  the gadoyanvirus' daemon is not running. That means no mail will go to the qmail queue.
  You might want to invoke gadoyanvirus everytime your computer boots.

  You may see messages like these below when trying to run gadoyanvirus:

  Couldn't bind socket file /opt/gadoyanvirus/.socket: Address already in use, trying to steal
  socket file /opt/gadoyanvirus/.socket successfully stolen

  Well, that's a normal behaviour. 
  
  The gadoyanvirus' daemon idea was intentionally designed
  to make gadoyanvirus lighter. All scanning process are done by this daemon.
  In the previous version, all scanning process were done by individual 
  gadoyanvirus process invoked by the smtp server. This caused gadoyanvirus to
  load ClamAV database all the time. But why don't you just use Clamd?
  You may ask. The answer is: I just want to do it that way (tm). 

  Every 5 minutes gadoyanvirus will see if there's a new virus database available
  and will try to reload it. A successful reload will be logged like this:

  Apr 30 23:48:31 gordon gadoyanvirus[10526]: Re-loading virus database

* invoke your smtp server using tcp.smtp rules above. If you don't know
  how to do this, refer to your qmail documentation.

* If a virus is catched you can spot it on the mail log like this:
  Apr 29 23:54:13 gordon gadoyanvirus[3191]: virus: 1083257653.3191.gordon.oo.cdl2000.co.id Worm.SomeFool.Gen-1

  First column is quarantined virus file and the second is the virus' name.

* gadoyanvirus will add a mail header on every mail it scan. The header is
  
  X-AntiVirus: gadoyanvirus VERSION

  with VERSION is the current version of gadoyanvirus
